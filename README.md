# RFCs

This repository contains Request for Comments (RFC) documents proposing technical solutions, protocol extensions, and architectural improvements for various systems and protocols.

## Purpose

RFCs in this repository aim to:
- Propose solutions to technical challenges in systems
- Document design decisions and trade-offs
- Enable community review and feedback before implementation
- Create a historical record of protocol evolution

## Structure

RFCs are organized by technology/protocol:
- `atproto/` - AT Protocol (Bluesky) related proposals
- `template.md` - RFC template for new proposals

Each RFC follows a standard format including motivation, detailed design, alternatives considered, and implementation plans.

## Contributing

Community feedback is welcome! Please open issues or discussions to provide input on existing RFCs or suggest new topics.
